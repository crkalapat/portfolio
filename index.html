                <p> Hi! My name's Charlie. Thanks for coming to check out my maker portfolio. I've included 3 projects here (4 if you count this website) that I personally am proud of and I think are cool. Hopefully they can give you
                    a better sense of the kinds of things that I make, and without further ado, enjoy!

                <h1 class="mt-4 proj-title" style="text-align: center">El Torito</h1>
                <p>El Torito (meaning "the bull" in English) was the byproduct of me and my grandpa collaborating to make art. 
                    Originally my grandpa had made the sculpture out of bronze by hand at a small scale, but he wanted it to be much bigger.
                    So, I worked with him and designed the sculpture using Autodesk Fusion CAD software. The CAD ended up being enough for
                    him to submit the design to art contests, and it was chosen for the Green Bay Rotating Arts Program in 2022. With the money
                    received from that, we got the chance to make the CAD full-scale out of metal, and showcase it in Green Bay, WI.

                <h1 class="mt-4 proj-title" style="text-align: center">Smart Door Knob</h1>
                <p>Unlike other smart door locks which you might find on Amazon or elsewhere, this door <em>knob</em> is designed to fit a typical
                    bedroom door (to keep siblings out of course). I designed the whole fixture in CAD to be small, lightweight, and 3D-printable, so that it could fit
                    on a typical door inside a home. In addition, I also made a custom PCB that integrates a servo motor, buttons, and wireless communications
                    so that the door knob can be unlocked manually with button input, or through Amazon Alexa, or even through my phone!

                <h1 class="mt-4 proj-title" style="text-align: center">iPad Letterboard</h1>
                <p>The iPad Letterboard app that I made was designed to be compatible with my little brother's spelling board that he uses to spell to 
                    communicate. The app was primarily designed to be used with his actual physical letterboard (pictured above on top of the iPad), so
                    that he could receive physical feedback whenever he was interacting with it. The app also made it so that tapping through the letterboard 
                    with a touch-screen compatible pencil would record the letter that he hit, so that the person he wants to communicate with could read
                    what he was trying to spell.
