# Maker Portfolio

A website that contains 3 projects that I have worked on and am proud of, with descriptions and images of the projects. It is
designed to mimic a maker portfolio, and to showcase what I have done to various insitutions and organizations. For the coding, I designed this portfolio using static HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
